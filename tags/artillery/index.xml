      <description>Load testing is an important part when you are designing any type of application, whether it is traditional EC2 based or container-based or a complete serverless application.
**Why is Load Testing important?__
Load testing will help us to find the following
- How fast is the system
- How much load can the system handle
- Under what conditions will the system fail
- Determine our applicationâ€™s capabilities by measuring its response time, throughput, CPU utilization, latency, etc.</description>
