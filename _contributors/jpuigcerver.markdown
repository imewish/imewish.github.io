I am Software Engineer in Research at Google Brain Zurich, and a former
PhD student at the Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology research
group.

Although I devoted my PhD to develop a probabilistic framework for keyword
spotting applied applied on handwritten documents, I am broadly interested in
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. These days, I am working with deep
generative models and unsupervised learning.

During my PhD I wrote a few pieces of software which have become quite popular
among handwritten text recognition researchers:
[Laia](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/Laia) and
[PyLaia](https://github.com/jpuigcerver/PyLaia).
