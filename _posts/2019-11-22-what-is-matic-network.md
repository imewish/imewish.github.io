Blockchain Smart contract platforms and cryptocurrencies have captured mass attention but still, havenâ€™t been able to achieve mass adoption due to scalability and user experience issues. Even on Ethereum, which is the most widely used smart contracts platform, there have been no significant Dapps that have seen mass adoption. There have been a few cases where one or the other application temporarily succeeded in achieving a significant user base, but it led to the crippling of the entire network during the high load times. Essentially meaning that even the most advanced and widely used platforms are not ready for mass adoption.
