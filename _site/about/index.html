<p>We want to give people the necessary tools to understand any field of machine learning, thus, avoiding the typical black-box/toy way of teaching Machine Learning you tipically find in many places. We do this just for fun, so we talk about what we think is important, what we like or what we find useful. We also use this to learn new things. We always try to give a reason further than intuitive. We do this to give you the necessary tools to understand complex works, and brind the gap between what you can find in toy courses and what you can find in the Bible of Pattern Recognition (Pattern Recognition from CM Bishop as example). We cover several topics, take a look at our index and about us for more information. If you want to collaborate, email us!!</p>

      <p>I am PhD researcher from Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology
research group at Universidad Politecnica de Valencia.
I created this blog with the help of Juan Sensio, who help me with web design.
The main reason for creating this blog is providing a more
grounded way of seeing things, which then can help you understand mostly
anything in front of you. During my studies, my talks with people, my
readings… I have realized that there is a big gap between what we
learn (at least in Spain) and what we really need to be competitive.
My intention is to help anyone bridge that gap so you can adquire the
same tools I use, that I am still learning and that have make me
experiment a big improve in my technical skills about statistics and
everything related to machine learning. I am looking for collaborators
so feel free to send me an email.</p>

<p>My fields of interests are generative modeling, semi supervised
learning, data scarcity scenarios, bayesian statistics and adversarial
examples. However, I focus my thesis mainly on bayesian statistics.
As you will see in my posts most of my interests have lots in common. I
also like CUDA programming. You can check my github to see my different
projects. For example I have programmed a class wrapper over CUDA to learn
CUDA. It is easy to follow, to use and to understand.</p>

      <p>I am Software Engineer in Research at Google Brain Zurich, and a former
PhD student at the Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology research
group.</p>

<p>Although I devoted my PhD to develop a probabilistic framework for keyword
spotting applied applied on handwritten documents, I am broadly interested in
Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. These days, I am working with deep
generative models and unsupervised learning.</p>

<p>During my PhD I wrote a few pieces of software which have become quite popular
among handwritten text recognition researchers:
<a href="https://github.com/jpuigcerver/Laia">Laia</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/jpuigcerver/PyLaia">PyLaia</a>.</p>
