This is a machine learning blog whose intention is to go over the technical background of machine learning, with some practical examples, implementations, tutorials...

We want to give people the necessary tools to understand any field of machine learning, thus, avoiding the typical black-box/toy way of teaching Machine Learning you tipically find in many places. We do this just for fun, so we talk about what we think is important, what we like or what we find useful. We also use this to learn new things. We always try to give a reason further than intuitive. We do this to give you the necessary tools to understand complex works, and brind the gap between what you can find in toy courses and what you can find in the Bible of Pattern Recognition (Pattern Recognition from CM Bishop as example). We cover several topics, take a look at our index and about us for more information. If you want to collaborate, email us!!
