Blockchain Smart contract platforms and cryptocurrencies have captured mass attention but still, haven’t been able to achieve mass adoption due to scalability and user experience issues. Even on Ethereum, which is the most widely used smart contracts platform, there have been no significant Dapps that have seen mass adoption. There have been a few cases where one or the other application temporarily succeeded in achieving a significant user base, but it led to the crippling of the entire network during the high load times. Essentially meaning that even the most advanced and widely used platforms are not ready for mass adoption.

On the other hand, there are a few smart contract platforms that boast of higher transaction throughput, but they trade off transaction speed with decentralization. Also, many of the upcoming solutions propose their own blockchains neglecting the network effects DApps and other projects have already generated on platforms like Ethereum and others. Even more importantly they neglect the massive developer community and developer ecosystem that exists for platforms like Ethereum.

[Matic Network](https://matic.network/) is a Layer 2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.

Matic strives to solve the scalability and usability issues while not compromising on decentralization and leveraging the existing developer community and ecosystem. Matic Network is an ​off/side chain scaling solution for existing platforms to provide scalability and superior user experience to DApps/user functionalities.
